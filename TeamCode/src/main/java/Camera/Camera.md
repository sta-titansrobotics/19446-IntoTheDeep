# Camera Folder Overview

This folder originally contained code and resources intended for developing and testing camera functionalities for the robot. The primary focus was on tasks such as:

- Detecting AprilTags using the C270 camera.
- Implementing a detection pipeline for processing camera input.
- Testing colour sensors for vision-related tasks.
- Exploring TensorFlow for object detection capabilities.

While these efforts were aimed at enhancing the robot's vision system, the decision was made to not use the camera on the robot, and the code in this folder is no longer in active use. It remains here for reference purposes only.
